Application URL -  https://samplevision-275523.uc.r.appspot.com/

**Description** : We have created a application using NodeJS and google vision API, which uploads an image and detecs its features 
using google client library. 
After uploading the image, Google Cloud Vision API is invoked for analysing the image to detect labels. And finally the results are returned in well formatted way with detected labels of the image.

We have used 3 things to develop this application:
Frontend for the user to upload an image.
Backend to invoke the Google Cloud Vision API & return the results to the user.
Google App Engine to deploy the app and authentication to generate download key(JSON) file.
